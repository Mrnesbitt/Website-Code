        <h1>Spotify Wrapped & My Favorite Albums</h1>

        <h2>Happy Holidays, all! I thought I’d share my Spotify Wrapped results because, honestly, 
            why not join in on the fun? Along the way, I’ll also talk about some albums I vibed with this 
            year and how they shaped my experiences. This post is a little more relaxed than usual—I just 
            want to wrap up the year with something lighthearted. </h2>

       <h2>Looking at my Wrapped list, I can’t help but reflect on where I was mentally during certain moments. Music has this incredible ability to transport us to specific points
         in life—moments we don’t realize are becoming core memories until much later. Platforms like Spotify Wrapped or Apple Music Replay have nailed this concept. They don’t just
          summarize your year in music; they attach metrics to memories.
        Seeing that I’m in the top 1% of fans for an artist or noticing a sharp 
        change in my listening habits during a certain month often triggers a reaction
         like, Oh, I was going through that or Yep, that tracks. It’s fascinating to see 
         how deeply music and life intertwine.</h2>

        <h2>It turns out there’s a scientific reason why music feels so tied to memory. Neuroimaging studies show that listening to music activates multiple regions of the brain simultaneously. 
            The auditory cortex processes sound, while the frontal and parietal cortices help interpret it, and dopamine—the “feel-good” chemical—floods your system. This is why certain songs 
            just hit differently, letting you lose yourself in the music.
            But music doesn’t stop there. It also activates the brain’s visual cortex, creating vivid mental snapshots. That’s why you can hear a track and instantly picture a moment, a place,
            or even a specific feeling. These connections are especially powerful for memories formed before age 25, thanks to something called the “reminiscence bump.”

            Think of it as a direct line to moments you might not have thought about in years. With all the brainpower music demands, it’s no surprise that musical nostalgia feels like a mental reset. Sure, it’s easy 
            to overindulge in the past and lose sight of the present, but studies show that nostalgia has meaningful benefits. A “special song” can immortalize a couple’s milestones, while a tune
            from college might instantly remind you of mornings with your roommate. As neuropsychologist Amee Baird explains, these shared musical memories deepen emotional bonds and strengthen our 
            connections with others. Not only that but, Music’s therapeutic effects extend even further. For individuals with dementia, a familiar song can unlock forgotten memories and spark brief 
            moments of clarity, reconnecting them to their former selves. In this way, music serves as both a bridge to the past and a powerful reminder of the human need for connection.

        <h1>Wrapped Up</h1>

        <h2> This year was filled with life-defining moments—seeing Nicki Minaj and Lil Dicky live, 
            witnessing the now-infamous Kendrick beef unfold, moving to a different state, and navigating grief and loss. 
            Amid it all, I found myself shaping my life into something closer to what I’ve always wanted. Through every high and low, 
            music was the thread that held everything together. Each song became a bookmark in time, and now, revisiting those tracks 
            feels like stepping back into those moments. So, let’s dive in!
