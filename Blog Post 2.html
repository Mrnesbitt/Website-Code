        <h1>AN ABSOLUTE BANGER - Spotify Wrapped and DC Comics</h1>
        <h2>
          Hello Travelers, I hope all is well! The year is winding down&mdash;elections are over,
          Thanksgiving leftovers are finally getting tossed, resolutions are being written, and chimneys
          are getting prepped for ole Saint Nick. (If you don&rsquo;t have a chimney, I hope this doesn&rsquo;t offend you.)
          Since we last caught up, I&rsquo;ve been keeping busy. I ran a 5K, recently moved, and have been on the hunt for comics. 
          And let me tell you, I must be getting better at this because I&rsquo;ve got an amazing haul to share! 
          The DC Absolute run is shaping up to be something spectacular. Only two issues in, and I&rsquo;m already itching for more content.
          Now, I know I missed the first issue of Absolute Superman and the second issues of Absolute Wonder Woman and Absolute Batman, 
          so I decided to go all out and write a major blog post once Absolute Superman dropped&mdash;which, thankfully, I was right on time for.
          (FYI: It&rsquo;s only procrastination if you can&rsquo;t stick the landing!)

        <h2>
          Absolute Batman #2 was a joy to read. The brutality and raw strength of Batman are on full display here. 
          The hulking, scary, force-of-nature aspect of him is really emphasized in this issue, while also showing his more 
          methodical and calculated side. The art is fantastic&mdash;scratchy and raw, yet subtle and beautiful in its own right.

        <h2>
          Batman&rsquo;s backstory and trauma are hinted at throughout the chapter, as well as the inner workings of Gotham, which is ever-crumbling. 
          The Party Animals and Black Mask are portrayed really well, and their dominance in Gotham is shown clearly. What also works in this chapter 
          is that for the first part, it&rsquo;s written from Alfred&rsquo;s point of view as he&rsquo;s stalking Batman, trying to track him down. (Don&rsquo;t ask questions, just read the comics!)

        </div>

        <h2>
          The reader is also shown that Black Mask and his gang are doing the same thing&mdash;trying to stay one step ahead of Batman. 
          There&rsquo;s a lot to love about this chapter and where things are going, especially with Bruce&rsquo;s friends (who, as we know, are really his villains). 
          But I want to leave some things for you to discover on your own. If you&rsquo;ve found your way to my little blog and haven&rsquo;t been spoiled, just dive in and enjoy! 
          Read all the way to the end for two big reveals that have me very excited for where things go next.
