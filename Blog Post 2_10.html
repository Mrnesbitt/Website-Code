      <h3>
        J. Cole consistently delivers, and Might Delete Later is no exception.
         While it didn’t hit as hard for me as some of his past work, it’s still 
         undeniably solid. Cole’s introspection and wordplay remain sharp, making 
         this album a worthy addition to his discography. His albums still carry that
          homey, “off the block” vibe. Originally, there was a diss track aimed at Kendrick 
          Lamar that got removed, which does take away from the experience a bit. However, Cole’s 
          mastery of his craft shines through. I really appreciate the well-placed samples throughout the album—they’re 
          funny and enhance the vibe. He can effortlessly shift from a gentle giant to someone who reminds you why he’s so great. 
          I remember listening to this album almost every day while living in a different state, despite the drama. The short runtime is
           also a plus, making it easy to revisit multiple times.
