    <h2>This is exactly what I&rsquo;ve been waiting for. I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect, 
        but I was definitely pleasantly surprised. Absolute Superman is fantastic. Aaron (writer) and Sandoval (artist) 
        really nailed it with their take on Superman and his entire mythos. From the lore of Krypton to Kal-El&rsquo;s powers, 
        and even the overall feel of the story&mdash;it all just works. Reading this felt like holding a mini movie in my hands.
         The art speaks volumes, adding depth to the narrative and really elevating the story. The pacing in the first issue is perfect.

        It focuses on Krypton before its eventual destruction, the different classes of Kryptonians, and the politics and corruption that
        entrap both the lower classes of Krypton and humanity. Kal-El (Superman) is definitely different from the Superman we know. He&rsquo;s
        still a fish out of water, but now he has a lot more edge and grit. He&rsquo;s depicted as a wrecking ball of unmatched power. Reading 
        this version of Kal felt like diving into a seinen manga, where the main character is fed up, jaded, and worn out.

        The core elements of Superman 
        are still there, but they&rsquo;re buried beneath the harsh reality that all the characters have to navigate. There's an evil army and mega-corporation 
        called Lazarus, Kal has a new companion named Sol, and Kal even grew his hair out. Before we go further, you might have noticed the pages are in black and
         white, and that&rsquo;s on purpose. I was lucky enough to grab the Noir edition of the first issue, and I honestly think it made the reading experience that much 
         better. It gives the story a more serious, impactful tone than it would have had in color. One thing I particularly love is how the color red is used in the noir 
         edition&mdash;it really intensifies the grit of the story.

         I won&rsquo;t spoil too much, so I&rsquo;ll leave it at this: Drop what you&rsquo;re doing and read Absolute 
         Superman. You won&rsquo;t regret it.</h2>
