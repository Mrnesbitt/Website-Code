    <h1> Absolute Wonder Woman Review</h1>
    <h2>    After all the effort I put into tracking down this comic, it had to be good, right? And good God, this first issue was amazing! It delivered action, impressive world-building, solid character development, incredible paneling, and best of all—it was just badass.</h2>

    <p>This iteration of Wonder Woman offers a fresh take on her origins. Following DC’s All In event, many core heroes got significant resets to their characters and backgrounds. Some changes are big, while others are more subtle. What's intriguing is how these characters keep their original essence while being reshaped into something new for this retelling.
        In this story, Diana is still an Amazon from Themyscira, but she’s been banished to Hell, and her caretaker isn’t even allowed to say the word "Amazon" (Cyber Monday must be a nightmare!).</p>

    <p>We get to see Diana’s origins unfold as she bonds with her new adoptive mother, learns dark magic, tames powerful beasts, and battles towering monsters.
    Diana sports a stunning suit of armor, flies on a skeletal horse, and wields dark magic against her foes. This version of Wonder Woman is incredible! I’d love to share more details, but honestly, it’s best to experience it firsthand. It’s engaging, and I hope my words—and the images I’ve shared—tempt you to pick up this issue. Trust me, you won’t need to visit three stores to find it, but if you do, it’ll be worth every effort!</p> 
<h2>Overall, Absolute Wonder Woman #1 is a spectacular start to a new chapter in Diana’s journey. With its rich storytelling and dynamic artwork, this comic is a must-read for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. I give it a solid 5 out of 5—you won’t regret diving into this adventure!</h2>
