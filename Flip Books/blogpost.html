            <h3>Date: October 12, 2024</h3>
            <h1>Hello, internet!</h1>

            <p>This is my first official blog post, inspired by a memorable trip to a comic book shop in Charleston, SC. Captain’s COMICS & TOYS is a shop I’ve often passed on my trips to and from the island, but for some reason, I never went in… until today. So, let me walk you through my short but pleasant experience. I promise it’s all leading somewhere—just stay with me.</p>

            <p>Walking into the shop, I was immediately greeted by a spacious area and two friendly faces behind the counter. (I regret not taking photos—I didn’t plan on writing a blog post today. So, we’ll make do with Google photos.)</p>

            <p>Nervously, I asked if they had the first issue of Absolute Batman, and to my surprise, they did. But that’s not really what made the experience worth writing about. There were two things that stuck out to me and compelled me to document the experience for internet strangers. (Hi, by the way.)</p>

            <p>The first thing that caught my attention was the overall vibe of the place. I know "vibe" is a cliché word, but it fits. I constantly hear that comics are hard to get into, that they aren’t exactly welcoming to new readers, and that they carry outdated stereotypes—nerds living in their parents’ basements, for instance. These generalizations are understandable on the surface, but they’re definitely outdated.</p>

            <p>With the rise of social media, superhero popularity, and the vast content inspired by comics and graphic novels, nerd/pop culture has become mainstream. Many people are diving into it headfirst. You watch a show, and instead of waiting for more of that, you find something else—something interesting, striking, and personal. We’re all looking for the next best story, and I believe comics hold those. (Granted, I am definitely biased, but it’s my blog, so I can say what I want.)</p>

            <p>Comic book shops are almost sacred places for the geek in all of us. They may seem hard to find or intimidating, but there’s more than meets the eye. Smaller shops have that cozy, hole-in-the-wall feel, making you feel like a local while igniting curiosity about the hidden gems you might uncover. Bigger shops, on the other hand, feel like bustling cantinas filled with like-minded individuals. These larger shops often have memorabilia like anime swords, action figures, retro games, and even couches to sit and read. Think of them as libraries, but more laid-back. They cater to all types of interests, bringing together various subcultures in one space.</p>

            <p>Bookstores like Barnes & Noble and 2nd & Charles also cater to nerds, creating a safe space for those with “nerdy” hobbies or interests. GameStop has started doing something similar by selling memorabilia, retro items, and more. When you think about it, GameStop was always one of the coolest places as a kid. It had everything—a spot to play demos, controllers, action figures—and it became that third place for gamers. While you may not visit GameStop as much now, it’s still a familiar spot. Even when you wander through Target or Walmart, you somehow end up in the gaming aisle. There’s a place for you there, even if it’s just to browse.</p>

            <p>The second thing I noticed was the guy next to me, casually reading his comic while I searched for mine. It wasn’t that his presence was out of the ordinary; it was the simplicity of the moment. We were both there, sharing the same space, just enjoying comics. It felt like being in the gym—both of us working on our own goals, whether it was setting a personal record or catching up with Spider-Man. It was a place where we both felt safe to exist. When he finished, he put the comic back and moved on, showing that you don’t need to spend money to enjoy these spaces. Comic shops are great for collectors, but they also offer a space where you can simply enjoy and explore without pressure. These shops often host local events like D&D games, card tournaments, and even cosplay parties, encouraging people to socialize and connect. Because they’re usually mom-and-pop shops run by fellow nerds, the focus isn’t on profit but on creating a welcoming environment. Unlike big retailers, these shops offer a personal touch and recommendations that introduce you to obscure yet fascinating stories. Even though places like Barnes & Noble, Books-A-Million, and others sell comics, they usually charge more, and they miss out on smaller, single-issue comics. And if you’re lost, the staff at these shops are knowledgeable and always willing to help.</p>

            <h1>TODAY’S HAUL</h1>

            <h2>Supergirl Special (2023) #1</h2>
            <p>- A great read. I’ve been a fan of Supergirl since Injustice 2. Ever since, I’ve been hooked on her "Killers of Krypton" run. Think of this comic as Friends meets Supergirl.</p>

            <h2>All In Special (2024) #1</h2>
            <p>- An amazing read. I came for Absolute Batman but found this new comic, and it blew me away. It’s innovative, telling two stories simultaneously, and you even have to read certain sections in reverse. The art and action are top-notch, and the ending left me excited.</p>
            <div class="image-section">

            </div>

            <h2>Absolute Batman #1</h2>
            <p>- The main reason I visited, and it did not disappoint. Batman is at his boldest, and the storytelling feels dynamic, much like My Hero Academia. The brutal and resourceful nature of Batman shines, and the art is fantastic. This issue, following the events of DC All In Special, flips the Batman story on its head, and I love it. It’s bold, and it feels like a classic statement—"I AM BATMAN." 10/10.</p>

            <p> Thanks for reading my blog! What started as a college hobby has blossomed into a lifelong passion for comics. 
                This website is a labor of love, and I'm committed to continuously writing and creating. As I navigate this new venture, 
                I apologize if this post feels a bit sparse; I wanted to share my thoughts today because if I didn’t, I might never take the leap. 
                So, here I am, embracing the journey. I have so much in the works and can't wait to return with more updates. 
                While I’m still figuring out a posting schedule, I'm excited to share my experiences with you.
