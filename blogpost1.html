          <h1>Hello, travelers!</h1>
            <p>So, Absolute Wonder Woman #1 recently hit shelves, and to nobody’s surprise, it sold out in a flash. Scalpers didn’t miss a beat, tripling the price like vultures. But me? I was on a mission: to get that issue at its retail price, no less. And while I may not have hit both goals, I’m a glass-half-full kind of guy, so getting even partway there feels like a win.
            This blog’s here to put you in the shoes of a comic lover on a quest. You know that feeling—the one where people gather for a huge Marvel release, concert tickets, or even the latest “must-try” sandwich? That’s how I felt about this comic, and this journey turned out to be worth the chase.</p>
        
        <h2>The Hunt Begins…</h2>
        <p>Saturday morning, I woke up exhausted from a long week. I’m half-awake, scrolling through TikTok, when it hits me: Absolute Wonder Woman is out! People are buzzing about it, articles are piling up with hype, and I’m just lying there, watching it slip through my fingers. I spring out of bed, with one goal in mind. How hard could it be to find a copy?</p>
        
        <h2>Scratch and Spin Comics</h2>
        <div class="image-section">

          </div>
        <p>First stop: Scratch and Spin Comics. It’s a favorite local spot here in Columbia, and I figured I might get lucky. This shop’s got everything: comics, video games, CDs, DVDs, records. 
          <div class="row">

        </div>

        <p>If it’s entertainment, it’s probably here, and you can get lost in the selection. But my mission was specific, so I went straight to the comic section.
          After searching on my own and coming up empty, I head to the desk to ask. And that’s when the journey really begins. The guy tells me Absolute Wonder Woman sold out fast, and the shelves were wiped clean. He says they might have more by midweek, but that wasn’t soon enough for me. Spotting my disappointment, he goes the extra mile, calling two other comic shops nearby to help me out. Energized, I’m off to my next stop.</p>
          </p>
          
          <h3>Result: No Luck</h3>
          <h3>Things I Liked: A huge selection, helpful staff, good music, and fair prices.</h3>

        <h2>Heroes & Dragons</h2>

          <img src="Images/IMG_1851.png" style="width:100%" class="responsive-image">
        </div>
        
        <p>Next up, Heroes & Dragons—the Scratch and Spin guy said this shop was my best shot. My plans to try a ramen spot in Florence had fallen through, so I figured, why not keep the hunt going?</p>

        <p>The moment I step in, I’m struck by the vibe. Heroes & Dragons feels organized and calm, with light streaming through the windows. It’s almost like walking into a friend’s library or a hidden library  filled with all the stories you didn’t know you needed. I felt at home, but unfortunately, they’d also sold out.  </p>

        <p>Apparently, it flew off the shelves before noon. At this point, my FOMO was at an all-time high, but I had one more lead to follow. </p>

          <h3>Result: No Issue </h3>
          <h3> Things I Liked: Beautiful, inviting space, organized layout, friendly staff, and good parking.</h3>

        <p> Editor’s Note: I did technically gave up the search on Saturday mainly becuase I wasn’t in the mood for more rejection.</p>
        
          <p>Fast forward to Monday evening. I’m driving home from work, still thinking about this elusive comic, when something catches my eye—a Batman sign outside a small building. Curious, I made some quick (and slightly questionable) driving maneuvers to check it out. And there it was: another comic shop I’d never even heard of! This felt like fate. I wasn’t actively hunting anymore, but I was in the right place at the right time.
          <p>I walk in, and my first thought is, “This place is cool.” It’s got a cozy, “hole-in-the-wall” vibe, with a back room full of vintage comics and $25 mystery boxes (mental note: return to this). It’s smaller than the other shops, but it has character—and best of all, they had what I wanted.</p>   
          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">

          </div>
          <p>I ask about Absolute Wonder Woman #1, and not only do they have it, but they’ve got variant covers too. The price? $15 (shoutout to capitalism). At first, I considered standing my ground on principle, but the cover art won me over. I even went back to my car to get cash. went back to my car, grabbed some cash, and just like that, after a random Monday stop, the quest ended with success. Absolute Wonder Woman #1 was mine.</p>          
          
        <h3> Result: Success! Things I Liked: Great selection, fair prices, fun mystery boxes, laid-back vibe, and solid staff.</h3>
        <h3>Things I Didn’t Like: Parking was tight, but hey, mission accomplished!</h3>

        <p> Was it a little ridiculous? Maybe. But that’s what makes collecting exciting. Sometimes it’s not just about getting the item but the experience of the hunt. Whether it’s for a comic, a concert ticket, or the best sandwich in town, the chase makes the find all the sweeter. </p>
