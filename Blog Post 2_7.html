      <h3>
        My first encounter with Tyler, The Creator was through Loiter Squad, and it wasn't until later in college that I truly dove into his music, thanks to some friends who introduced me to his work. To this day, listening to Tyler still feels like an entirely fresh experience with every track. On his latest album, he absolutely nails it, delivering creativity, storytelling, and musicality at a 10 out of 10—it’s nearly perfect.
        <br /><br />
        What stands out most about this album is how Tyler has woven a deeply personal story that reflects the complexities of the Black experience. He explores themes of constant paranoia—like the fear of being followed and double-checking locked doors—along with his fear of pregnancy, commitment, hidden family dynamics, trauma, and even the regret of damaging his hair. But by the end, he lets go of past anger and trauma, like a child releasing a balloon into the sky. Everything here feels raw, authentic, and personal. It’s not just rap or hip-hop—it’s something beautiful.
        <br /><br />
        This album feels like a masterwork, meticulously crafted with purpose and care. Nothing feels out of place or unnecessary; every sound is intentional. Listening to it is like witnessing a renaissance artist pulling together the greatest talents to create something larger than themselves. The features Tyler brought in are perfectly executed, with everyone playing their part flawlessly. Tyler becomes both the conductor and the coach, guiding his team of artists to seamlessly pass the baton from one track to the next, like a relay. There are cheerful melodies that make you nod along, and funky beats that harken back to his earlier works like Igor and Flower Boy.
        <br /><br />
        This album isn’t just a collection of songs—it’s an artistic journey.
